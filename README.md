PAL Interpreter
=======
This is an interpreter written for the RPAL functional language.

**There are three ways to view the abstract syntax tree:**
 
* Use the p1 script provided: <code>p1 -ast &lt;filename&gt;</code>

* Use the makefile: <code>make run cmd='-ast &lt;filename&gt;'</code>

* Invoke the parser yourself (after compiling the code, of course): <code>java P1 -ast &lt;filename&gt;</code>

**To run a diff on the AST generated by this code and Steve Walstra's C implementation, run**:

<code>make test</code>

This requires you to have the tests to run in the directory <code>~/rpal/tests/</code>

### Completed:

* Scanner (lexer + screener)

* Parser

### Under development:

* AST standardization

* Interpreter using CSE Machine
